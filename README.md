Common-Sync-Problems
====================
These are my solutions to some common synchronization problems solved using semaphores on parallel C scripts.

bridge.c --> is the problem of 3 type of people trying to cross a bridge with some constraints in the type of people that can cross the bridge at a time.

water.c --> is the problem of creating water molecules with some given hydrogen and oxygen atoms having constraint on the energy of reactions and the number of reactions taking place simultaneously.

course.c --> is a general course allocation script for a large number of students and courses. 

Note : read code snippets for better understanding.
